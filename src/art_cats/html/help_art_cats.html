  <h1>Spreadsheet cataloguing</h1>
  <p>This app is designed for non-cataloguers to enter information which can then be transformed into bibliographic records (Marc 21 RDA records) for upload to ALMA. It deals with most of the tricky markup and linking aspects but there are a few things that you need to know in order to use it effectively. The following information should help you:</p>

  <h4>First, check title against SOLO!!!</h4>
  <p>This is essential to avoid creating duplicate records. If a record already exists, do not enter the details on the spreadsheet.
  <p>NB. It may be more efficient to check a number of titles against SOLO and then switch to enter the details into the spreadsheet, rather than jumping between SOLO and the app each time.</p>

  <h4>Capitalisation</h4>
  <p>Data is generally entered in sentence case (even if it is all in capital letters on the resource) unless there is a reason for it to be capitalised, e.g. an acronym, proper noun, or entering text in say German, where all nouns must be capitalised. </p>

  <h4>Incomplete records</h4>
  <p>Records must include the following minimum information to be saved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the language(s)</li>
      <li>a title</li>
      <li>a country and place of publication</li>
      <li>a publisher</li>
      <li>the height and number of pages</li>
      <li>a year of publication</li>
      <li>the barcode</li>
    </ul>
  <p>These mandatory fields are marked with an * in their title on the form.</p>
  <p>Records must also be complete to be locked.</p>

  <h4>More help</h4>
  <p>There is detailed help below about each of the input fields. You can either scroll down or <b>click on a title</b> in the form: that will automatically bring the help topic into view.</p>

  <h4>Locking / Editing</h4>
  <p>By default, complete records are locked for safety. Toggle the <code>unlock</code> button if you want to edit them further.</p>

  <h4>Red Backgrounds</h4>
  <p style="background-color: mistyrose;">Don't worry if the background of the field you are typing in suddenly turns pink: it just means that you are overwriting an existing record.</p>
  <p> If this is your aim, continue to type and press <code>Save</code> when you've amended the record and it will be saved in its new form.  </p>
  <p>If you were overtyping a record by mistake, just go backwards or forwards to the next record and your overtyping will be forgotten.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, press <code>New</code> if you want to keep your changes as a new record.</p>

  <h4>Backups</h4>
  <p>Everytime a record is submitted, it is backed up to a file unimaginatively named <code>[original file name].new.csv</code></p>

  <h4>Deleting records</h4>
  <p>If you <code>Clear</code> a record and then <code>Save</code> it, it will be deleted.</p>

  <h4>Item policy</h4>
  <p>See <a href="#hol_notes">HOL Notes</a></p>

  <h2 id="sublib">Sublibrary</h2>
  <p>Enter the sublibrary which the materials belong to (<code>BODBL</code>, <code>RSLBL</code>, <code>ARTBL</code> or similar). Team Leaders can advise.</p>

  <h2 id="langs">Language of resource</h2>
  <p>This is required in order to sort the records at a later stage in the process. Enter the language in which the resource is written (e.g. English or French). If the item has multiple languages, this should be entered as, e.g. <code>English/German</code>. (You can also use spaces or commas as separators.) Put them in order of priority, for instance: if the resource is mainly in Chinese, but has a parallel title in English, it should be labelled <code>Chinese/English</code>. This allows the app to process titles etc. correctly for the particular language.</p>
  <p>You can use LLC language codes if you wish, but if in doubt, use the full English form.</p>

  <h2 id="isbn">ISBN(s)</h2>
  <p>Enter if applicable.</p>

  <h2 id="title">Title</h2>
  <p>Transcribe the title using <b>sentence case</b>. Include any initial article, e.g. <code>The</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>La</code>, <code>Der</code> (this will be automatically tagged as non-filing).</p>
  <p>If you want to add an <b>alternative version</b>--typically to expand an acronym or to represent a number that has been spelt out in letters as digits (e.g. <code>CNG</code> -> <code>Classical Numismatics Group</code> or <code>forty-two</code> -> <code>42</code>), type the full alternative title after the official one, separating the two with the sign *//*</p>
  <p>If a title divides naturally (because of punctuation) into several parts, put the first part into the main Title field and ALL the others into the Subtitle field. The subtitle doesn't need to be further subdivided. For example: "Osian's dare to care: an initiative for the adolescent girl -- a charity fundraising gala event" should be split: Title="Osian's dare to care", Subtitle="an initiative for the adolescent girl -- a charity fundraising gala event". Note also that the punctuation (here a colon) separating the title from the subtitle should be omitted.</p>

  <h2 id="subtitle">Subtitle</h2><span id="parallel_subtitle"></span>
  <p>Transcribe the subtitle, omitting any initial article. Begin with a <b>lower-case</b> letter (unless the first word of the subtitle requires a capital letter e.g. a proper noun in English or a German noun). See "Title" for alternate subtitles.</p>

  <h2 id="parallel_title">Parallel title</h2>
  <p><i>(For dual language items only)</i></p>
  <p>Transcribe the parallel subtitle, omitting any initial article. Begin with a <b>lower-case</b> letter unless the first word of the parallel subtitle requires a capital letter (as for Subtitle). See "Title" for alternate parallel subtitles.</p>

  <h2 id="tr_title">Transliteration<span id="tr_subtitle"></span><span id="tr_parallel_title"></span><span id="tr_parallel_subtitle"></span></h2>
  <p>Only for all languages with non-Latin scripts. Make sure you follow the relevant Library of Congress transcription guidelines for each language.</p>

  <!-- <h2 id="statement_of_responsibility">Statement of responsibility</h2>
  <p>Transcribe in full exactly as it is written. This may just be the author's name or may include e.g. edited by...</p> -->

  <!-- <h2 id="edition_statement">Edition statement</h2>
  <p>Transcribe if applicable.</p> -->

  <h2 id="country_name">Country of publication</h2>
  <p>Enter the country of publication.
  <p>NB. If the resource was published in a place which is now in a different country, enter the present-day name of that country (e.g. Bratislava is now in Slovakia although at time of publication it was in Czechoslovakia)</p>
  <p>The spelling, capitalisation etc. don't really matter, so <code>USA, U.S.A., usa, the United States of America</code> will all work. You will get an error if the name isn't recognised. Also, if you know the LCC country code, you can use this (capitalisation is ignored).</p>
  <p>For places in the US, Canada, UK and Australia, a 'state' is expected. For the UK, 'state' means 'England / Ireland / Scotland / Northern Ireland'. For some common cities, such as New York and London, the state can be left out.</p>

  <h2 id="state">State</h2>
  <p>This is needed only for states that have a 3-letter country code: The USA, the UK, Canada & Australia. Transcribe from the resource. NB. In the case of the UK, this means simply specifying <code>Northern Ireland</code>, <code>England</code>, <code>Scotland</code> or <code>Wales</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="place">Place of publication</h2>
  <p>Transcribe from the resource.</p>

  <h2 id="publisher">Publisher name</h2>
  <p>Transcribe from the resource. If working in a non-European script, use the publisher's English name. In the rare event of there being two or more, equal publishers, simply add the one listed first and ignore the other(s).</p>

  <h2 id="pub_year">Date of publication</h2>
  <p>Enter the year of publication ONLY from the resource.
  <p>Do not record day/month.</p>
  <p>Add a question mark for conjectured dates [i.e. <code>2015?</code>]</p>

  <h2 id="copyright">Copyright date</h2>
  <p>If the resource has a copyright date, input the date (without the © symbol: this will be inserted automatically). </p>

  <h2 id="extent">Pagination</h2>
  <p>Enter the number of pages, e.g. vii, 504. Do not add the words <code>pages </code>, <code>pp.</code>, etc.</p>
  <p>If the number of pages is not given explicitly, add a question mark after your guesstimation / count, i.e. <code>175?</code>.</p>
  <p>Do not record illustrations, maps etc.</p>

  <h2 id="size">Size</h2>
  <p>Measure height of book and round up to nearest centimetre but do not include <code>cm</code>, <code>cms</code>, <code>centimeters</code>, etc., as this will be added automatically] i.e, 22 cm</p>

  <h2 id="is_illustrated">Illustrations</h2>
  <p>Select <code>None</code> if there are no illustrations and <code>Partial</code> if there are illustrations, even quite extensive, but the text could in principle stand alone without them.Choose <code>Full</code> if the text would lose its meaning without the illustrations, as is the case with many auction catalogues.</p>

  <h2 id="series_title">Series title</h2>
  <p>Transcribe from the resource.</p>

  <h2 id="series_enum">Series enumeration</h2>
  <p>Transcribe from the resource.</p>

  <h2 id="note">Note</h2>
  <p>Add notes for anything unusual or relevant about the book, e.g. Title from cover or listings on the title page in the case of art catalogues, if it helps to differentiate resources with very similar titles.</p>

  <h2 id="sales_code">Sale code</h2>
  <p>(Additional field for Auction Catalogues)
  <p>This is a numeric or alphanumeric code assigned to a sale, usually found on the catalogue's title page but sometimes further in. Be wary of numbers found on the spine, which are sometimes incomplete.</p>
  <p>If there are multiple sale codes, these should be entered as, e.g. <code>ORCHID27</code>, <code>LILY35</code></p>
  <p>Where they are already included in the title, that is enough. Think of the Sale code as being something someone might search for to find the item on the catalogue so e.g. <code>38A230503</code> might be helpful (although it is only the auction number and date) but just <code>27A</code> isn't that useful. The Sotheby catalogues show how distinctive some of them are. </p>

  <h2 id="sale_dates">Date of sale</h2>
  <p>(Additional field for Auction Catalogues)</p>
  <p>Use the format YYYYMMDD for a single date. If the date is incomplete, record as much of the date as is known and use hyphens for the missing digits.</p>
  <p>If there are multiple dates, these should be entered as, e.g. <code>20210724, 20210731</code></p>

  <h2 id="hol_notes">HOL notes</h2>
  <p>Add notes pertaining to the copy in your hand, e.g.<code>a donor note</code>; <code>Missing pages 4-5</code>.</p>
  <!-- <p>If the book's <b>item policy</b> should be <code>"Use_in_Library_Only"</code>, then type <code>***lib only**</code> (exactly as is) as the FIRST thing in this field. Otherwise, the default is <code>"Fixed_Week_Loan"</code>.</p> -->
  <p>If the book's <b>item policy</b> should be <code>"Fixed_Week_Loan"</code>, then type <code>***f week**</code> (exactly as is, one space) as the FIRST thing in this field. Otherwise, the default is <code>"Use_in_Library_Only"</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="donation">Donor note</h2>
  <p>For example: <code>Donated by the Ashmolean Museum</code> or <code>Anonymous donor</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="barcode">Barcode</h2>
  <p>Attach the barcode onto the item in the top left-hand corner of the front cover and scan the barcode into the field. </p>
  <p>If you type <code>*dummy*</code> into this field, it will allow you to save an incomplete record.</p>
